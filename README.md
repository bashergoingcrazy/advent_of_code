## My advent of code list
This is specially for 2024 where I am trying to learn a new language (Go)

### Learnings
- Go is a simple and elegant one
- The more I write in Go the more I like it more then C++
- Although it doesn't provide the powers to pointer arithematic but most of the hurdles of C++ are not faced in this
- Quite easy to get into in my opinion
- I am knee deep just topics on go coroutines and concurency are left to study
- I can't currently apply the go coroutines or can I?
